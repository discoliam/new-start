          <p>8. If you provide personal information to me about other individuals (including medical or financial 
                      information) you should inform the individual about the contents of this Privacy Notice.  We will also
                      process such information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>  
           
          <p>9. In addition, you should note that in the event you amend data which we already hold about you (change of address or telephone number) then we will update our clinical record systems to reflect the amendments.  Our systems will continue to store historical data.</p> 

          <h4>Personal information</h4>

          <h4>Special Categories Personal Information</h4>

          <p>11.  As one of our patients / clients, we will hold information relating to your medical treatment which is known as a special category of personal data under the law, meaning that it must be handled even
                     more sensitively. </p>

          <ul>
            <li>a) Details of your current or former physical or mental health, including information about any healthcare you have received from other healthcare providers such as GPs, dentists or hospitals (private and/or NHS), which may include details of clinic and hospital visits, as well as medicines administered. We will provide further details below on the manner in which we handle such information.</li> 
            <li>b) Details of services you have received from us</li>

          </ul>
          

          <p>12.  The confidentiality of your medical information is important to us, and we make every effort to 
                     prevent unauthorised access to and use of information relating to your current or former physical
                     and mental health (or indeed any of your personal information more generally). In doing so, we will
                     comply with UK data protection law, including the Data Protection Act 2018 and all applicable
                     medical confidentiality guidelines issued by professional bodies including, but not limited to, the
                     Health and Care Professions Council.</p> 

          <p>13.  From 25 May 2018, the current Data Protection Act will be replaced by the EU General Data 
                    Protection Regulation (GDPR) and a new Data Protection Act. All uses of your information will
                    comply with the GDPR and the new Data Protection Act  from that date onwards </p>

          <p>14.  We may collect personal information from a number of different sources including, but not limited 
                    to:</p>

                    administered. </p>

<h4>          From third parties
</h4>
          <p>18.  As detailed in the previous section, it is often necessary to seek information from other healthcare 
                    organisations.  We may also collect information about you from third parties when: </p>
           
           <ul>
             <li>a) You are referred to us for the provision of services including healthcare services</li>

             <li>h) We liaise with Government agencies, including the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office and HMRC </li> 
           </ul>
         

          <h4>How will we communicate with you? </h4>

          <p>19.  We may communicate with you in a range of ways, including by telephone, SMS, email, and / or
                    post.  If we contact you using the telephone number(s) which you have provided (landline and/or
                    mobile), and you are not available which results in the call being directed to a voicemail and/or
                    answering service, we may leave a voice message on your voicemail and/or answering service as
                    appropriate, and including only sufficient basic details to enable you to identify who the call is from, 
                    very limited detail as to the reason for the call and how to contact us.  
                     </p>
          
          <p>20.  However: 
                    a) to ensure that we provide you with timely updates and reminders in relation to your healthcare (including basic administration information and appointment information (including reminders)), we may communicate with you by SMS and/or unencrypted email (where you have provided me with your SMS or email address).  
                    b) to provide you with your medical information and/or invoicing information, we may communicate with you by email (which will be encrypted unless you have requested that we send it unencrypted and accept the potential risks associated with this) where you have provided me with your email address. The first time I send you any important encrypted email, I will endeavour to contact you separately to ensure that you are able to access the encrypted email you are sent.</p>
           
          <p>21.  Please note that although providing your mobile number and email address and stating a preference to be communicated by a particular method will be taken as an affirmative confirmation that you are happy for us to contact you in that manner, we are not relying on your consent to process your personal data in order to correspond with you about your treatment.  As set out further below, 
                    processing your personal data for those purposes is justified on the basis that it is necessary to
                    provide you with healthcare service. </p>

<h4>          What are the purposes for which your information is used? 
</h4>
          <p>22.  We may 'process' your information for a number of different purposes, which is essentially the
                    language used by the law to mean using your data. Each time we use your data, we must have a
                    legal justification to do so. The particular justification will depend on the purpose of the proposed
                    use of your data. When the information that we process is classed as a “special category of personal 
                    information”, we must have a specific additional legal justification in order to use it as proposed.</p>
           
<p>          23.  Generally we will rely on the following legal justifications, or 'grounds': 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) Taking steps at your request so that you can enter into a contract with me to receive healthcare services from us. </li>
  <li>b) For the purposes of providing you with healthcare pursuant to a contract between you and
  us. We will rely on this for activities such as supporting your medical treatment or care and
  other benefits, supporting your nurse, carer or other healthcare professional and providing
  other services to you. </li>
  <li>c) We have an appropriate business need to process your personal information and such
  business need does not cause harm to you. We will rely on this for activities such as quality
  assurance, maintaining our business records, monitoring outcomes and responding to any
  complaints. </li>
  <li>d) We have a legal or regulatory obligation to use such personal information. </li>
  <li>e) We need to use such personal information to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.</li>
  <li>f)  You have provided your consent to our use of your personal information.  </li>
</ul>
         

          <p>24.  Note that failure to provide your information further to a contractual requirement with us may mean that we are unable to set you up as a patient or facilitate the provision of your healthcare. </p>
           
<p>          25.  We provide further detail on these grounds in the sections below. 
</p>
<h4>          Appropriate business needs 
</h4>
          <p>26.  One legal ground for processing personal data is where we do so in pursuit of legitimate interests 
                    and those interests are not overridden by your privacy rights.  Where we refer to use for our appropriate business needs, we are relying on this legal ground. </p>

<h4>          The right to object to other uses of your personal data 
</h4>
         <p> 27.  You have a range of rights in respect of your personal data, as set out in detail in sections 53-70 
                     below. This includes the right to object to us using your personal information in a particular way 
                     (such as sharing that information with third parties), and we must stop using it in that way unless
                     specific exceptions apply.  This includes, for example, if it is necessary to defend a legal claim
                     brought against us, or it is otherwise necessary for the purposes of your ongoing treatment . </p>  

       <p>   You will find details of our legal grounds for each of our processing purposes below.  We have
                   set out individually those purposes for which we will use your personal information, and under
                   each one we set out the legal justifications, or grounds, which allow us to do so.  You will note
                   that we have set out a legal ground, as well as an 'additional' legal ground for special categories of personal information.  This is because we have to demonstrate additional legal grounds where using information which relates to a person's healthcare, as we will be the majority of the times we use your personal information.</p>  
           
<h4>          Purpose 1: To provide you with healthcare and related services
           </h4>           
       <p>   28.  Clearly, the reason you come to us is to provide you with healthcare, and so we have to use your
                 personal information for that purpose.  </p>
           
          <p>29.  Legal grounds: <br />

                    a) Providing you with healthcare and related services <br />
                    b) Fulfilling our contract with you for the delivery of healthcare </p>
<p>
          30.  Additional legal grounds for special categories of personal information: <br />
          a) We need to use the data in order to provide healthcare services to you <br />
          b) The use is necessary to protect your vital interests where you are physically or legally 
          incapable of giving consent </p>

<h4>          Purpose 2: For account settlement purposes
</h4>
<p>          31.  We will use your personal information in order to ensure that your account and billing is fully 
           accurate and up-to-date </p> 
           
          <p>32.  Legal grounds: <br />
                     a) Our providing you healthcare and other related services <br />
                     b) Fulfilling our contract with you for the delivery of healthcare<br />
                     c) Our having an appropriate business need to use your information which does not overly prejudice you  <br />
                     d)  Your consent</p> 

          <p>33.  Additional legal grounds for special categories of personal information: <br />
                    a) I need to use the data in order to provide healthcare services to you <br />
                    b) The use is necessary in order for me to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights<br />
                    c)  Your consent </p>

<h4>          Purpose 3: For clinical audit purposes  
</h4>
<h4>          Clinical audit
</h4>
   <p>       34.  We may process your personal data for the purposes of local clinical audit – i.e. an audit carried 
                out by ourselves or our direct team for the purposes of assessing outcomes for patients / clients
                and identifying improvements which could be made for the future.   We are able to do so on the
                basis of our legitimate interest and the public interest in statistical and scientific research, and with
                appropriate safeguards in place.  You are, however, entitled to object to our using your personal 
                data for this purpose, and as a result of which we would need to stop doing so.  If you would like to 
                raise such an objection then please contact us using the details provided in paragraph 3 above.</p>   

     <p>     Purpose 4: Communicating with you and resolving any queries or complaints that you might
                have.  </p> 

   <p>       35.  From time to time, patients may raise queries, or even complaints, with us we take those communications very seriously.  It is important that we are able to resolve such matters fully and properly and so we will need to use your personal information in order to do so. </p>
           
      <p>    36.  Legal grounds: <br />
                a) Providing you with healthcare and other related services <br />
                b) Having an appropriate business need to use your information which does not overly <br />
                prejudice you  </p>
           
<p>          37.  Additional legal grounds for special categories of personal information:<br />
          a) The use is necessary for the provision of healthcare or treatment pursuant to a contract with a health professional <br />
          b) The use is necessary in order for us to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights </p>

<h4>          Purpose 5: Communicating with any other individual that you ask us to update about your care 
          and updating other healthcare professionals about your care.</p>
</h4>
           38.  In addition, other healthcare professionals or organisations may need to know about your treatment in order for them to provide you with safe and effective care, and so we may need to share your personal information with them.  Further details on the third parties who may need access to your information is set out at section 47 below. </p> 
   <p>        
             39.  Legal grounds:<br />
             a) Providing you with healthcare and other related services<br />
             b) We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that other healthcare professionals who are routinely involved in your care have a full picture of your treatment  </p>
           
 <p>         40.  Additional legal ground for special categories of personal information:<br />
           a) We need to use the data in order to provide healthcare services to you <br>
           b) The use is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest under UK law<br />
           c) The use is necessary in order for us to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights </p>

<h4>          Purpose 6: Complying with our legal or regulatory obligations, and defending or exercising our legal rights

    <p>      41.  As a provider of healthcare, we are subject to a wide range of legal and regulatory responsibilities
                which is not possible to list fully here.  We may be required by law or by regulators to provide
                personal information, and in which case we will have a legal responsibility to do so.  From time to
                time, clinicians are unfortunately also the subject of legal actions or complaints.  In order to fully
                investigate and respond to those actions, it is necessary to access your personal information
                (although only to the extent that it is necessary and relevant to the subject-matter).</p>  
           
<p>          42.  Legal grounds:<br />
          a) The use is necessary in order for us to comply with our legal obligations </p>

<p>          43.  Additional legal ground for special categories of personal information: <br />

          a) We need to use the data in order for others to provide informed healthcare services to you <br />
          b) The use is necessary for reasons of the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems  <br />
          c) The use is necessary for establishing, exercising or defending legal claims  </p>

<p>          44.  We are also required by law to conduct audits of health records, including medical information, for 
          quality assurance purposes. Your personal and medical information will be treated in accordance
          with guidance issued by the Care Quality Commission (England), Health Inspectorate Wales and
          Healthcare Improvement Scotland  </p>

<p>          Purpose 7: Managing our business operations such as maintaining accounting records, 
          analysis of financial results, internal audit requirements, receiving professional advice (e.g. tax
          or legal advice) </p>
<p>
          45.  In order to do this, we will not need to use your special categories of personal information and so 
          we have not identified the additional ground to use your information for this purpose.  </p>
           
<p>          46.  Legal grounds:
</p>
<p>          a) Our having an appropriate business need to use your information which does not overly prejudice you
