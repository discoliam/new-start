            <blockquote>Rob has visited us on several occasions for advice on our baby girls milk intolerance & weaning issues. Great service, excellent advice which helped me feel more confident trying different foods.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>We had a brilliant experience with Rob when he came to our home yesterday evening to help us with a dairy-free diet for my nearly 2 year old. Having him come home was convenient for us as we were able to carry on getting kids ready for bed</blockquote>

            <blockquote>We had a brilliant experience with Rob when he came to our home yesterday evening to help us with a dairy-free diet for my nearly 2 year old. Having him come home was convenient for us as we were able to carry on getting kids ready for bed.<br /><br />
            Rob was very patient with us and all the questions we had for him. He is full of knowledge and gave some brilliant advice. At no time did we feel rushed by Rob and he took down very detailed information about my daughter. The report for the consultant and GP were ready the same night was very impressed with that!</blockquote>

            <h3>April 2016 - 5*</h3>
            <blockquote>
            Rob has been extremely helpful. We have a 10yo high functioning autistic daughter with severe anxiety, who sometimes controls the anxiety and associated sensory overload through food. Rob spent time with her and introduced her to a new way to approach food that she finds far less intimidating. He identified some key 'tricks' to help her deal with a loss of appetite on highly anxious days.<br /><br />
            We have been really pleased with what was covered and have been able to implement Rob's suggestions. We've had a couple of family taste sessions already, which have been successful.<br /><br />
            Our daughter got on very well with him too. We would definitely have no hesitation in recommending Rob.

            <blockquote>
            After an appointment with Rob I'm now armed with brilliant info and practical advice to tackle my sons CMPA and weaning. Highly recommended-thank you Rob!

            <h3>April 2016 - 5*</h3>
            <blockquote>
            I can honestly say that Rob from New Start Nutrition has made an enormous difference to our lives with a once very unsettled, unhappy new born. Rob listened intently to the day to day issues causing our baby such upset and knew exactly what questions to ask to get to the bottom of the cause of such restlessness and sickness. With a sympathetic ear and obvious knowledge Rob helped us identify CMPA causing reflux and skin irritation. Armed with information from New Start I was able to get exactly the right medication from my GP saving time in NHS waiting lists. My baby changed within a week into a happy relaxed well fed boy. Thank you Rob.

            <h3>December 2015 - 5*</h3>
            <blockquote>Rob came to our home last week to review and advise our 9 year old daughter, who has recently been diagnosed as suffering with Coeliac Disease. He was recommended by our Gastro consultant and he was indeed a great help to us at an anxious stage in our daughters life. We found him to be not only efficient and flexible in initially making the appointment, but also very personable and a wonderful combination of professional, informative and approachable all rolled into one! He put our children at ease and spoke directly to our daughter, as opposed to over our daughter, which was greatly appreciated by both us and our daughter. Rob gave us the much needed impetus to face this diagnosis and the tools to continue to manage it going forward. I highly recommend him and hope to consult him again along our Gluten free journey for more tips! Thanks Rob!</blockquote>

            <h3>November 2015 - 5*</h3>
            <blockquote>Found this service excellent. My son has a dairy allergy and had been refusing to drink prescription formula. Rob came to visit us at home and was very helpful, took the time to listen to my concerns and gave some very useful advice. I would highly recommend. Thank You Rob after a good few months feeling rather stressed I'm starting to feel a lot better!</blockquote>

            <h3>November 2015 - 5*</h3>
            <blockquote>Rob was recommended to me as I needed advice following my son's milk protein intolerance diagnosis and aversion to weaning. From our first point of contact he provided great advice and tips and by the time of our appointment, after taking his advice, my son was already eating two small meals a day. Our appointment was in the evening and, after meeting our son, Rob spent over an hour with us discussing how we could move forward. His manner was friendly and relaxed and he provided us with lots of ideas for moving forward. We had his report for our GP a couple of hours later. All in all an excellent, professional service and great value for money, I wouldn't hesitate to use him again.</blockquote>

            <h3>November 2015 - 5*</h3>
            <blockquote>I highly recommend this company. Rob came over this evening to assess my daughter who has a Cows Milk Protein Allergy and suffers from silent reflux. He has given us lots of information on how to start weaning her and how to make it a positive experience. We have already received his written report less than 2hrs after he left. Sound advice, friendly and approachable but very professional too, thanks Rob.</blockquote>
